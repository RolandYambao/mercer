# User Stories: Mercer

Mercer is a crowdsourced online marketplace powered by everyday entrepreneurs (like you!). From the latest and greatest in high-end electronics, to rare and unexpected collectibles and antiques, you’re only a few clicks away from discovering yet another amazing deal. <br><br>

Mercer was built for our vendors - making it fun, fast, and easy to quickly list and trade whatever they'd like, in bulk. We believe that as we continue to improve our vendor store management system, we’re providing an even more amazing customer experience as a result.

## Here's Ours

Overview:

- As an `Mercer-Seller`, I want to `bulk-list a ton of my old stuff`, so that I can `sell it quick and easy, for a good price`

- As an `Mercer-Buyer`, I want to `find amazing deals on products in the world of whatever my interests are`, so that I can `buy those items for a price i'm happy with`

Or more precisely:

- As a `seller` I want to `sell all my old gym stuff from the garage` so that I can `fit my car in the garage again`

- As a `buyer` I want to `buy gym equipment` so that I can `get in shape before summer`


### Actors

The `buyer` is the second subject of Mercer. They are our Mercer shoppers.

The `seller` is the first subject of Mercer. They are our Mercer vendors.

As inferred above, a seller may transition their role (if they want to do some shopping themselves from other vendors), likewise a buyer may become a seller over the course of their presence on the application.

### Interaction

An `action` is a verb describing a clear interaction with an external object (or objects) e.g.:

- View
- Select
- Add to Favorites
- Made an Offer/Reserve Item/Counter-offer
- Check-out

An `object` is any thing (or _collection_ of things) we might interact with e.g.:

- Shirts
- A Shirt
- An auction table (item page)

An object can also include tags, or object _properties_  - e.g., _shirt colour_, _shirt size_, etc.

If we put action and object together:

- I want to view shirts
- I want to select a shirt colour
- I want to select a shirt size
- I want to add a shirt to cart
- I want to make an offer on a shirt listed for sale
- I want to reserve the shirt to see it in person first
- I want to pay the full price from the seller to buy the shirt immediately

### Objective

An `objective` is the intent of the interaction i.e., the _why_. An objective is also _action oriented_ however, it describes action towards internal goals, rather than external interaction.

Our Mercer objectives are:

- Explore
- Discover
- Communicate
- Continue
- Achieve
- Complete

Our `intent` for Mercer actors:

Sellers:
1. my sale (theme)
    - so that I can categorize my products in a recognizable way
2. my listing settings
    - so that I can interact with buyers the way I want
3. my sale statistics
    - so I can see how i'm doing and where i can improve
4. the reach of my presence
    - so i can see what i need to do to reach more people, and who i'm able to reach already

Buyers:
1. My preferences
    - so i can control what items show up more often
2. My options
    - so i can represent myself as a reliable and trustworthy buyer
3. A passion
    - gives me a reason to explore what's being offered



## The Mercer User Story - Simplified:

- _As a seller, I want to offer a selection of shirts, so that I can serve potential buyers with a variety of options_
- _As a buyer, I want to purchase a new shirt, so that I can look great for my job interview_
